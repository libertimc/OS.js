**This version is no longer in active development. Please check out version 2 in my other Github project page: http://andersevenrud.github.io/OS.js-v2**

# About OS.js:
OS.js is a simple, yet powerful JavaScript Cloud/Web Desktop Platform.

~~A live demonstration is available on http://OSjs.0o.no~~

Only WebKit and Gecko based browsers fully support Glade/Gtk+ due to incomplete implementation of various
CSS features.

OS.js can also be deployed standalone, either running in a browser or on top of X11 as a complete Graphical Environment.

## This is the new Node.js branch

This version runs purely on JavaScript. It can be deployed as a system-wide service or be run as a normal web application.

This is a work in progress so expect bugs and random crashes!

For more information see `INSTALL`, `ChangeLog` and `TODO`
